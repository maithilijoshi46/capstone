**Objective:**

Instacart is challenging the Kaggle community to use anonymized instacart orders data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a userâ€™s next order.

*The datasets within this repository are:*
aisles.csv - all aisle data
departments.csv - all department data
products.csv - all product data
order_products_prior.csv - priors user reordering data
order_products_train - training user reordering data
orders_train_new - the dataset I used WITHOUT object variables after merging.
orders_train_all - the dataset I used WITH object variables after merging.
priors_sample - smaller, randomly sampled, subset of data from orders_train_new
